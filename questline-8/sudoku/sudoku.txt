Solved puzzle

1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
3 4 1 2 
2 1 4 3

Step 1 - The first 3 columns are already occupied with 3. So the only place remaining for 3 in the  last column is the bottom-last cell.

Step 2 - The only place remaining for 1 in the first 2x2 square is the first cell because the other cells are already overlapped with a 1 in the second row and the fourth row.

Step 3 - Now that we have three 1's, it is obvious that the fourth 1 will come in the third cell of the third row 

Step 4 - As we have all the 1's and 3's now, I randomly assigned 2 and 4 in the first 2x2 cell and went with the flow in the other cells without overlapping
